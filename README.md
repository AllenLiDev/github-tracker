### Libraries Used:
Axios
Github Api
React
Recharts
Semantic UI

### Worked with:
Manipulating data in maps, arrays and JSONs to display in visual form to be quickly received by users.
Building reusable components. IE searchbar.
Creating non static components as different users have different activity types.

### Future implementations and goals:
Working / learning with GraphQL to get only necessary data fields.
Getting user total line^ changes and use that data to return comedic reference to a SV character relative to work done.
^ better represent work done as to small events that may not have much content.
